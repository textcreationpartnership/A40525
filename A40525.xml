         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OH ye wiſe ones of the earth! (that are in Authority to ſit in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) lend your ears, and hear in this the day of your viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 44. and be not lifted up in pride of heart, and bitterneſs of ſpirit againſt the Lords Heritage, which the proud, and lofty Rulers, and envious Magiſtrates hath oppreſſed grievouſly, as you your ſelves may very well know, &amp; conſider what hath been their pretence, and what hath been their reward in the end: Have they not been overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, broken, and ſcattered as the chaffe before the winde? And had this happened a great while ago, in another Age, or a far off in Forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, then had there been more neceſſity for me to have ſpoken more larger of what hath been acted by them, and what hath happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; but you that are not wilful and blind, have your own ſelves both ſeen and heard of their moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable cruelty which they have acted, eſpecially upon thoſe deſpiſed People which live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, although others (that are not according to their minds) hath not altogether eſcaped their wicked Decrees: Therefore in the pure fear of the Lord I exhort you that are more tender-hearted, and do feelingly know what they have done, that you take heed that none creep in among you to corrupt you, but conſider truly and honeſtly, ſo as to let thoſe things which hath been done by them, and that which came upon them, befor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples unto you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. ſo that you may by no means be perſwaded to do as they have done, neither to ſuffer that to ſtand which the Papiſt of old, &amp; the oppreſſors of late hath ſet up, which is contrary to the will of God, &amp; the publike good of the Common-Wealth; for becauſe of theſe, and ſuch things, the Lords hand was againſt them, to cut off ſome of the chiefe of them, and to give the other up to be ſcattered as the ſmall duſt of the earth before the winde; therefore you that are in their places, liſten a little, and incline your ears to hear the voice of the juſt, and your hearts to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ye Heads of theſe Nations, for unto you I write in obedience to the ſpirit, and in love to your ſouls, you are all to be turned in unto the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſpirit which is given to every man to profit withall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. and ſo all to learn of it how to perform and bring to paſs the good works which many hath promiſed to do, but hath not performed them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they took counſel, and not of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. and went out from the manifeſtation of the ſpirit in them, which is light, and deſpiſed it's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and ſo hated the inſtruction of the juſt within, and took counſel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with the chief prieſts, (as the phariſees did) without, in darkneſs,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36197:3"/> and the prieſts being of ſo many opinions, and in ſo much confuſion and oppoſition one againſt another, but all in darkneſs: And the people that know no other Preacher but the Prieſts, they are all like the prieſts, for the prieſts have taught them ſo to be, for ſo the leaders of the people hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to err, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. And the people (by the inſtructions of the prieſts) hath made choice of men of ſeveral opinions unfit to ſit in Parliament, yet ſuch have for a time ſate as members in Parliament, &amp; others that hath meant wel, that are not taught by the prieſts, they have made choice of ſuch as would have done that which the Lord requireth, which is, to undo the heavy burdens, and let the oppreſſed go free: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 6. So ſome were for taking off oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and others for laying it on, and when theſe came together, there were diviſions among themſelves, ſome for that which was right, and others for that which was wrong, and the prieſts party (made up with many Lawyers) being the greater in number, as you your ſelves very well know, that they that would have done good, knew not how to perform it becauſe of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers which did oppoſe them; and if there be ſuch among you, they will hinder you if they be not rem<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ved in time; And therefore I warn you who are in Authority, that you may not take counſel of the many prieſts, to be deceived by them, if they ſhould do as they have done, that is, to come bowing and crouching with flattering titles, from their lying lips, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful hearts, and with their ſeigned Petitions, which they call Humble: And this hath been their manner of creeping (unawares) into the hearts and affections of Parliament-Men, and others, to draw their minds from the pure principle of God in them, which ſhould have taught them to have been of one mind, and ſo to have proceeded, to the glory of God, and for the publike good of the Nation, according to the will of God; and this are ye witneſſes of: Therefore all you that are of ſuch a noble mind, to do juſtice, and to love mercy, and walk humbly with God, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 8. [Mark] you muſt all take counſel together of the Lord, and ſo come to be all taught by one Teacher within you all, that ſo you may come all to ſtand together in the Counſel of the Lord, who hath given the manifeſtation of the Spirit to every one of you to profit withall, and all that profit with the manifeſtation of the ſpirit (which is light) they muſt owne that to be their Teacher, to teach them how to caſt off every weight and burden, and the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Now you muſt of neceſſity be turned unto the light of Chriſt in you, before you can ſee or know what doth oppreſs, and what is oppreſſed in every particular; and I ſay unto you as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid unto the <hi>Romans, That which may be known of God, is manifeſted in you; Rom</hi> 1. 19. and therefore you are to come unto a teacher within you, which would teach every one how <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Hammons</hi> proud, envious

And ſo of a truth, if you ſhould take counſel of the many prieſts to be divided, you muſt not think to ſtand: Therefore in obedience unto the everlaſting truth, and in love unto your ſouls do I write unto you, that you may be all warned in time, to own the onely true teacher within you, which is Chriſt the light, and believe in him for ſtrength and ſalvation, ſo may you come to be all of one heart, and of one ſoul, as the multitude were, and are, that did, and do believe in the light, and ſo may you be made both able and willing to proceed and go on together, doing that which is good, and undoing that which is evil, fearing the Lord, and hating covetouſneſs; and fear not men, but fear the Lord, and look unto him for ſalvation, and wait upon him to have your ſtrength renewed, for his Arm is ſtretched forth, and revealed to uphold thoſe that walk in his light, to his own praiſe and glory, who is God over all bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>To all the valiant Officers and Souldiers, ſmall and great, amongſt whom I was for many years, a private ſouldier, Corporal, and Serjeant, in the time of the late wars, and now in the bowels of love, and in obedience unto the ſpirit do I write unto you, that the noble principle o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of the chief particulars: Some of the chief Officers of the Army they lov'd to be honoured by men, others they coveted to be rich, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they went into pleaſures, as Hunting, Bowling, and ſporting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the day time, when they ſhould have paid their vows unto the Lord, by fulfilling their promiſes; and others into careleſneſs and eaſe in the fleſhly mind, others into oppreſſion, talking of reformation, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36197:4"/> as the phariſees did, to have the praiſe of men: And others were turned unto a meaſure of the true light in their conſciences, and bore a teſtimony for the Lord againſt evil doings; and moſt of us came out, and were turned out from amongſt you for the truth's ſake, when we had finiſhed, and were finiſhing our teſtimony: And ſo you may ſee your foes were them of your own hearts at the laſt; and in that time the Parliament lent their ears unto the prieſts that ſought their gain from their quarter, that came flattering with their Petitions for Augmentations, becauſe they are greedy, and never have enough, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56 11. And the Parliament were ſo deceived by their good words and fair ſpeeches, that they went from their work, which was to do juſtice in taking off oppreſſion, and in their dark minds ſet themſelves to grope after Religion, thinking to ſettle that without man, which the Lord by his power alone ſetleth in the hearts of his people; but there about the Parliament ſate a long time dreaming, until <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> turned them out of the Houſe: And thus they were deceived by the ſubtilty of the Serpent, which hearkened unto the prieſts. And after there was another Parliament which did begin as if they would have done ſomething for the Common-Wealth; for they began to conſider the great oppreſſion of tythes which the Popes power cauſed to be taken from the people unjuſtly, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their unrighteous Worſhip. But you may remember very well how the prieſts did flock together, and ride, and run, and ſo beſtirred themſelves with their flattering titles, and their deceit unto the Rulers, fearing greatly they ſhould looſe the inheritance which the Pope their Father in the time of popery, moſt unjuſtly took from the people, and gave unto the Jeſuits, and ſo tythes came unto theſe prieſts that are of the Popes ſtock: But thoſe children of the <hi>Romish Whore</hi> (the falſe <hi>Church)</hi> did ſo prevail with the Rulers, that they got that Parliament ſuddenly turned forth, and then there were inventions to ſtrengthen the old papiſts Laws by which the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath been grievouſly oppreſſed; for ſome of the prieſts hath taken near ten times as much as is their due according to the Popes allowance at the firſt; yet the prieſts were not ſatisfied, but ſtill thirſted after blood. And laſtly, there was a Parliament to be choſen, and then the prieſts ſtirred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain exceedingly, crying, when men were mentioned to ſit in Parliament, <hi>Are they for tythes?</hi> So that if the honeſt people had made mention of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men, they could not chuſe ſuch in many places, becauſe the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that follow the prieſts were the moſt in number, and ſo chuſed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Members which ſome thought they would have ſatisfied the prieſts thirſt with blood, and they proceed not onely to oppreſs the Lords people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but they ſought to oppreſs all others that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from them, both Army, and all well-affected people thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then in due time were they diſcovered unto you that did return the eyes of your minds in a little unto that noble principle which did once ſtir you up againſt perſecution for conſcience-ſake, and that did manifeſt unto you your unfaithfulneſs in not performing what you had promiſed to do, and ſome of you did make a pretty honeſt confeſſion, although others might oppoſe you in that thing, as they have done in other things that were honeſt: But conſider, had you done before what you have begun, and now
